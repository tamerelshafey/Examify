# Project Overview: Examify

## 1. Vision & Mission

**Vision:** To revolutionize online assessments by creating the world's most trusted, intelligent, and insightful platform.

**Mission:** We leverage artificial intelligence not just to ensure academic integrity, but to transform test results into actionable insights. Our goal is to empower educators, streamline corporate training, and provide learners with personalized paths to success.

## 2. Target Audience & Roles

Examify is designed as a multi-tenant platform serving various roles within the educational and professional ecosystem:

-   **Teachers/Educators:** The primary creators. They can build exams, manage questions, monitor students, and analyze class performance.
-   **Examinees/Students:** The test-takers. They experience a secure testing environment and receive valuable post-exam feedback and learning tools.
-   **Corporates:** Use the platform for hiring assessments and internal skill evaluation. They focus on candidate integrity and data-driven talent management.
-   **Training Companies:** Manage certifications and course assessments for their trainees at scale.
-   **Admins:** Have super-user privileges to oversee the entire platform, manage users, and configure system-wide settings.

## 3. Core Modules & Features

The platform is built around several interconnected modules:

#### A. Exam Creation & Management
-   **Manual Creation:** An intuitive form builder supporting various question types (MCQ, Essay, Ordering, etc.).
-   **AI-Powered Generation:**
    -   **Generate from Prompt:** Create entire exams or individual questions from a simple text prompt (e.g., "Create a 10-question quiz on React Hooks").
    -   **Import from Text:** AI intelligently parses unstructured text from a document (Word, PDF) and converts it into a structured exam, saving hours of manual work.
-   **Exam Variants:** Create unique versions of an exam with a single click using AI to prevent cheating.

#### B. AI-Powered Integrity & Security
-   **Smart Proctoring:** Real-time analysis of a user's camera, microphone, and on-screen activity to flag suspicious behavior (e.g., looking away, multiple faces, mobile phone detection, tab switching).
-   **Integrity Reports:** Generates a detailed post-exam report for the examiner, highlighting flagged events with timestamps and severity.
-   **Plagiarism & Authenticity:** For essay questions, the AI can check for plagiarism against web sources and also analyze the text to determine the likelihood it was written by another AI.

#### C. The Examinee Experience
-   **Secure Test Environment:** A focused, timed interface for taking exams.
-   **Detailed Review:** Post-exam, students can review their answers, see the correct ones, and understand their mistakes.
-   **AI Study Buddy:** A conversational AI tutor on the dashboard that can answer questions about topics and provide practice questions on demand.
-   **Personalized Learning Paths:** After a poor performance, the AI can generate a custom study plan, identifying weaknesses and suggesting resources and practice questions to help the student improve.
-   **Oral Exam Practice:** A feature where students can practice speaking on a topic with an AI that provides feedback on fluency, pronunciation, and grammar.

#### D. Analytics & Insights
-   **Performance Dashboards:** Visual representation of key metrics like average scores, pass rates, and score distribution.
-   **Question Analysis:** Identifies the most difficult and easiest questions in an exam, helping educators pinpoint common areas of struggle.
-   **AI-Generated Summaries:** The AI provides natural language summaries of exam performance, highlighting key trends and offering pedagogical recommendations.
-   **Student Risk Prediction:** Identifies students who are at risk of falling behind based on their performance trends.

#### E. Question Bank Ecosystem
-   **Personal Banks:** Each creator (Teacher, Corporate, etc.) has their own private, reusable question bank.
-   **Marketplace & Monetization:**
    -   A central hub where authors can submit high-quality question banks for review.
    -   Authors can set a price for their approved banks, turning their expertise into a revenue stream.
    -   Users can browse, preview, and purchase banks from the marketplace to add to their own collection. The platform facilitates this exchange, typically taking a small commission.
-   **Author Zone:** A dedicated dashboard for creators to track the status of their submissions, view sales data, and monitor their earnings.
-   **Community & Rating System:** Users can rate the banks they've acquired, helping to surface high-quality content and build a trusted community of creators.
